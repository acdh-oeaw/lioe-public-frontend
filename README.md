LIÃ– Website
===========

This repository contains the two parts of the environment/container making up the lioe website

* in `server` you find a small server that contains a few endpoints that translate between a more browser friendly api
  and the elasticsearch native API
* the rest of the sources are running in the browser

Development
-----------

For development if you want to do anything with involving data in elasticsearch you need to run the server part in addition
to the vite dev server. This is already preconfigured for you when running `npm run dev`.
Note that this sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development` and therefore loads the environment from the `.env.development` file.

Building
--------

You can test building the site using `npm run build`.
Note that this sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` and therefore loads the environment from the `.env.production` file.

Developing tests
----------------

For testing (playwright e2e testing) the code is built for production (`npm run build`). After it is build
you can launch the test development environment using `npm run test:ui`. Every test should run without
error in this environment.
To be sure you can also run `npm run test` before you push because this is what runs on the build server.

Test the container image locally
--------------------------------

You can test the container image from the build server locally (e.g. the dev branch):

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 registry.gitlab.com/acdh-oeaw/dboe/lioe-website/dev start
```
